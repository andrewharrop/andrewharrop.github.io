# Manufacturing Consent by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky
[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12617.Manufacturing_Consent)

The premise of this work is to explore the influence that politics and business interests have on the mass media. It is centred around the American media industry, and is somewhat of a timepiece, heavily emphasizing events that took place in the 40 years before its publishing (1988), and generally more attention paid to recent events(under Carter/Reagan) than to more distant ones. 

## Chapter 1: A propaganda model

#### Summary: 
The authors develop a propaganda model for the media. They think of it as a set of filters between the truth of a matter and the published version. They also have ideas about the criteria for a story to reach publication.

### The 5 propoganda filters:
#### 1. Size, ownership, and profit orientation of the mass media
<!-- + The interests of the owners need to be considered.
+ The owners are typically some of the wealthiest members of society.
+ The largest media companies have achieved a sort of economy of scale in the industry. 
+ Think of the difficulty a small town newspaper would have in reporting on events overseas. This capability has been somewhat diminished since the publishing with the advent of social media. -->
#### 2. The advertising licence to do business
<!-- + Media must pander to the interests of advertisers.
+ Threat of reprisals allow advertising entities to influence media. -->
#### 3. Sourcing mass-media news
<!-- + At the time of publishing, many events were reported to the media by a primary source rather than the media being the primary source itself.
+ In war, the primary source is usually one of the warring parties. There is an inherent conflict in partisan primary sources.
+ The U.S. Government is used as an example. Operations in Vietnam and South America are reported on and justified by the very entity that carries out the operation.
+ Another example was the intellectual support for an issue. Governments support those who support their own cause, creating a feedback loop. Academics and experts with the best funding tend to be given much more attention than those with opposing views. -->
#### 4. Flak and the enforcers
<!-- + The ability to produce sustained and widely disseminated criticism of the media is held by the wealthiest and most powerful institutions.
+ Similar to the second point, mass media falls in line with the threat of loss of reputation in the public eye. -->

#### 5. Anticommunism

<!-- + Not as relevant today.
+ If you are not staunchly anticommunist, then you are an enemy of the state.
+ Forces events to be interpreted in a certain light.
+ Also forces media to criticize any element that is not as anticommunist as those with interests in the media would like.
+ I believe that this point could have been better generalized as conformation with widely accepted ideologies of the time, and examples of anticommunism as support. -->


#### Some examples are given:
+ A democratically elected leader (Juan Bosch in the Dominican Republic. He is not aggressively anticommunist. The media holds a highly negative opinion of him and he is overthrown nine months after he is elected.
+ The mass murder of communists sympathizers in Indonesia. Because the victims of this genocide were alleged leftists, it was generally acceptable in the opinion of the U.S. Government.

## Chapter 2: 

#### Summary:
This chapter distinguishes worthy and unworth victims. The authors mention [Jerzy Popiełuszko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Popie%C5%82uszko) as a worthy victim, and numerous cases pertaining to the U.S. supported junta in El Salvador (notably [Óscar Romero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93scar_Romero)) as unworthy victims. The Popiełuszko case is also contrasted with a series of murders in Guatamala.
> *Definition: People abused in enemy states [are] worthy victims, wheras people treated with equal or greater severety by its own government or clients will be unworthy.*

#### Worthy victim: Jerzy Popiełuszko
Jerzy Popiełuszko was Polish priest murdered by Polish police. It is important to note that at the time Poland was within the Soviet sphere of influence. Because Soviet Poland meets the criteria of an enemy state of the United States, Jerzy Popiełuszko is considered by the authors to be a worthy victim. His murder, the investigation, and the trial are extensively covered in the American media, and his killers are identified.

#### Unworthy victim: Óscar Romero and other victims of the Salvadoran military dictatorship
The Salvadoran Junta came to power when the democratally elected president was overthrown in 1931. The Junta was militaristic and right leaning. The U.S. government generally condoned the Junta leadership and ignored human rights abuses. A developing resistance to the Junta created a demand for U.S. arms and advice. In the ensuing conflict, there were numerous murders of civillians who peacefully opposed the Junta. These murders included Óscar Romero, 4 women who were American missionaries, members of the clergy, and members of indegenous populations. Although the murders were calculated, brutal, and comprable to sensationalized cases of violence in other countries, they were rarely mentioned and if mentioned only briefly in the media. They are mentioned as a clear cut example of unworthy victims.
