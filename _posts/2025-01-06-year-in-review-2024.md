First post

This year was marked by personal growth, travelling, and new experiences. The highlights for me were the trips to Lewisporte (NL, picture below) and Punta Cana. Its not often that you feel like a tourist in your own counrty. Lewisporte and the areas of central Newfoundland we visited had a unique culture much different than any other community I have seen in Canada. It was a bit sad to see the toll of rural flight though. It seemed like around every turn was a shutterd business of a house with a caved in roof. Everyone we met had an acute awareness of the situation but had little idea of a solution. My take was there may not be a solution. Economic isolation seemed as much a problem as geographic. You either work in services, fishing, or forestry; as awareness grew about the oppertunities in St. Johns and off the island, youth decided that they wanted to live different than their parents. It was one of the most beautiful places I have seen in the country. 

 I finished 17 books, my favorites were [The Undertow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61089467-the-undertow) and [Leadership: In Turbulent Times](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38657386-leadership). [Going Infinate](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/149105520-going-infinite) was also excellent, I don't think the backlash Michael Lewis received was justified.
 
 The new position I have started in has exposed some interesting technology to me, and to see the system with a few years of experience on a different team has given me the ability to see some areas of improvement as well as plenty of oppertunity for growth.

In 2025 I want to try to focus on what is within my control. Focus and time management are two things I think I can improve on most.
